Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you can find some of the projects and work I've done as an aspiring healthcare data scientist.

## Projects

### Project 1: Movie Recommendation
- Description: In this project, I created a function to which movies a user would watch
next if they have watched Planet Hulk based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.
- Repository: [Semantic Similarity- watch_next ](https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone/blob/main/watch_next.py)

### Project 2: Predictive Modeling for Insurance Charges
- Description: This project involved building a predictive model to forecast insurance charges based on data. I applied Simple linear regression, a machine learning algorithm, to create accurate insurance charge predictions based on a customer's age, and visualised the results.
- Repository: [Simple Linear Regression - insurance](https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone/blob/main/Simple%2Blinear%2Bregression%2Binsurance.ipynb)
